# NST model for histopathological images
The aim of this project is to implement a neural style transfer network which can transfer the pattern from a histological slide stained with hematoxylin-eosin, to an other slide without any type of stain. 
The first step is to obtain a neural network, so it's obtained by training it using two images:
